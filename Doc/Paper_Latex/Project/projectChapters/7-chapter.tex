\chapter{Conclusion}
The project focuses on development of a deep learning model that can recognize clouds in satellite images. The U-Net architecture, a convolutional neural network based method, is used to define the model. The Landsat 8 satellite imagery dataset was used to training and testing the model. The task of binary classification for cloud presence and absence was successfully handled by the model. Additionally, the model performed semantic segmentation to precisely identify cloud regions within the images.

The model produced good results in cloud detection from satellite images after intensive training over 20 epochs using IOU as the saving criterion. The accuracy value was reached at \%91. By leveraging the information provided by the model, the non-informative regions dominated by clouds can be efficiently filtered  before subjecting the imagery to further algorithmic processing. This contributes to enhancing the overall effectiveness and accuracy of information retrieval procedures utilizing satellite imagery.
